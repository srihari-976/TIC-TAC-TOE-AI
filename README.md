# AI Tic-Tac-Toe Agent

## Overview
This project implements an AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe agent that plays against a human player. The AI utilizes the **Minimax algorithm**, a decision-making approach used in two-player games, to determine the best possible move at each turn. The goal of this project is to provide an engaging and challenging gameplay experience while demonstrating the effectiveness of the Minimax algorithm in solving games with perfect information.

## Features
- **AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe** gameplay against a human player.
- **Minimax algorithm** for optimal decision-making.
- **Customizable game board size** (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, etc.).
- **Interactive graphical user interface (GUI)** for seamless gameplay.
- **Real-time feedback** on game status, including win, loss, or draw.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**
- **HTML & CSS**
- **Minimax Algorithm**

## How to Play
### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/srihari-976/TIC-TAC-TOE-AI.git
cd TIC-TAC-TOE-AI
```
### 2. Open the Game
Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

### 3. Gameplay Instructions
- Choose the size of the game board (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, etc.).
- Play against the AI by selecting your moves on the game board.
- The AI will respond with its best move based on the **Minimax algorithm**.
- Continue playing until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Example Screenshot
(Include a screenshot of the game interface here if available)

## Limitations
- The AI's performance depends on the board size and the depth of the Minimax search tree.
- The implementation may not be optimized for **very large game boards** due to computational complexity.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you would like to enhance the project, feel free to submit a pull request with improvements or bug fixes.

## Acknowledgements
This project is inspired by the **classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe** and the elegance of the **Minimax algorithm**. Special thanks to the open-source community for valuable resources and contributions.
